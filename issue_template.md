# Brisbane Python User Group meetup checklist

- [ ] choose day (default: second Wednesday of the month)
- [ ] choose venue (current default: River City Labs, 315 Brunswick St)
- [ ] choose topics/find speakers (see the talks repo for ideas)
- [ ] announce on MeetUp (requires organiser access to the MeetUp group)
 - please use a suffix of "BrisPy: " for all meetups
- [ ] arrange food sponsorship (current default: Superloop)
- [ ] preorder food (see current default food order below)
- [ ] check waitlist numbers the week of the meetup and post MeetUp comment to remind folks to adjust their RSVP if they can't make it
- [ ] post MeetUp comment to thank attendees, speakers & sponsors and provide a pointing to the talks repo to both request and offer talks
- [ ] file the admin issue for the next month's MeetUp

## Meetup announcement notes:

- start time is 5:45pm for a 6:00pm start
- mention the day & date in the meeting title (MeetUp's UI doesn't make it very prominent otherwise)
- thank both the venue sponsor and the food sponsor

## Speaker organisation notes:

- use the talks repo, that's what it's for :)
- the PyCon Australia schedule can also be a good resource for finding folks that are local to Brisbane and willing to talk about Python in public
- we aim for talks to run for 25-30 minutes, including time for questions (not coincidentally, this is also a typical PyCon AU timeslot)
- make sure speakers know which of them is speaking first
- make sure speakers have a mobile contact number for at least one of the organisers

## Meetup notes:

- explain the general plan for the evening (first talk, food, second talk)
- cover venue logistics in initial introduction (bathroom locations, fire exits)
- if the venue has guest wi-fi, make sure you know the password

Default food order is 2-3 share platters from Art of Catering.
